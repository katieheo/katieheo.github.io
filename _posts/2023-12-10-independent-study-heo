In our study of ["Beyond the 405 and the 5: Geographic Variations and Factors Associated With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Positivity Rates in Los Angeles County"](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33141164/) by Tara Vijayan et al., 
[Alex](https://alexxuyide.github.io) and I aimed to reproduce and evaluate the ... . Vijayan et al. originally sought to .... . They conducted their study by ... , and we 
attempted to reproduce their results. 

In looking at the hexagonal grid to overlay COVID data, we observed threats to validity in the boundary effect, also known as 
the edge effect in the holes observed in between the hexagons that present census tracts in Los Angeles county. As Rolf R. Schmitt 
outlined in **Threats to Validity involving Geographic Space**, some issues that arose that we tried to resolve in our reproduction study
was partition distortion. We were able to do this by creating a hexagonal layer that better fitted the COVID data. 

Another issue we resolved was selection bias - the data we used for SLM analysis for the age-adjusted diagnosis rates and 
age-adjusted testing rates were not explicitly presented in the main paper. Vijayan et al. did not explicitly present the tables 
that they did not succeed in reproducing and instead just attached them as supplementary data. Hence, we worked on reproducing all 
tables from the study.

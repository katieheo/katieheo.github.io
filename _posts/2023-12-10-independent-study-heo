In our study of ["Beyond the 405 and the 5: Geographic Variations and Factors Associated With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Positivity Rates in Los Angeles County"](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33141164/) by Tara Vijayan et al., 
[Alex](https://alexxuyide.github.io) and I aimed to reproduce and evaluate the ... . Vijayan et al. originally sought to .... . They conducted their study by ... , and we 
attempted to reproduce their results. 

In looking at the hexagonal grid to overlay COVID data, we observed threats to validity in the boundary effect, also known as 
the edge effect in the holes observed in between the hexagons that present census tracts in Los Angeles county. As Rolf R. Schmitt 
outlined in **Threats to Validity involving Geographic Space**, some issues that arose that we tried to resolve in our reproduction study
was partition distortion. 

The choice of a hexagonal grid as the spatial unit of analysis introduced the risk of the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem. 
This problem arises when the results of an analysis are dependent on the arbitrary choice of spatial units. In this case, 
aggregating data into hexagons masked important variations at a finer spatial scale and introduce distortion in the observed
relationships. Hence, we recreated the hexagonal layer to get rid of the gaps. 

Another issue we struggled with was assumptions in data translation to hexagonal grid, as Vijayan et al. did not provide sufficient 
details on how the translation from original geographic units (tract, city, and county levels) to the hexagonal grid was performed. 
The lack of clarity on how centroids were associated and whether multiple tracts, cities, or counties intersected the same 
hexagonal unit introduced uncertainty and potential bias in the analysis.

Standardization of Variables:
The lack of clarity on whether the response variables were standardized in addition to the predictor variables raises concerns 
about the proper interpretation of coefficients in the spatial regression models. The omission of the model intercept further 
complicates the interpretation of results.

Limited Sensitivity Analysis:
The study does not appear to include a comprehensive sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of results to variations in 
the choice of hexagon size or other methodological decisions. This omission raises concerns about the stability of the reported 
findings.

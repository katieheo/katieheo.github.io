In our study of ["Evaluating social vulnerability indicators: criteria and their application to the Social Vulnerability Index"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11069-019-03820-z) by Seth E. Spielman et al., we aimed to replicate and evaluate the Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) model. Spielman et al. originally sought to assess the internal and theoretical consistency of the SoVI, a widely used measure of social vulnerability to environmental hazards. They conducted their study by replicating the SoVI model for different geographic extents, and we attempted to reproduce their results.

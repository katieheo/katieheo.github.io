Science builds on previous theories, takes empirical data, is complex, and makes meaning out of discoveries. Whether GIS counts as "science" depends on one's perspective. I have been using GIS as a scientific tool to collect, manage, analyze, and visualize spatial data in my Human Geography with GIS class. GIS is often considered a scientific tool because it enables the rigorous analysis of spatial data, which is a fundamental aspect of many scientific disciplines. However, the perception of GIS as a science itself, like physics or biology, may vary. Some view it as a tool applied within the context of various scientific fields, while others see it as a science that continuously evolves with its own set of theories and methodologies. 

So far, I used GIS as an applied science by addressing practical, real-world problems by applying GIS knowledge and tools to solve spatial issues. Although I use GIS as a tool, I do see it as a scientific discipline.

The theme of singular technology and progressing along a linear path highlights the idea that GIS is a single, unified technology that follows a linear path of development and advancement. In reality, GIS encompasses a wide range of tools, software, and methods, and it did not necessarily follow a linear progression. So far, I have not felt like any of my instructors made these arguments necessarily. I think that this perception of singularity can oversimplify the complexity of GIS and may lead to misunderstandings about its capabilities.

GIS being inherently expansive and growing worries me as the technology may become overly complex or resource-intensive. What is good about this is that GIS promotes the need for critical thinking and the need to acknowledge its diverse applications and the complexities involved. At the end of the day, GIS is a versatile tool with broad applications.

This topic reminded me of the conversation my dad and I had this summer about what GIS is as I consider pursuing further studies in it. He wondered how effective GIS is depending on the different problems being addressed and the quality of the data available. To that, I told him that what I have learned so far is that GIS is a versatile tool that would be useful to know but should be used in consideration of its appropriate application to specific contexts.

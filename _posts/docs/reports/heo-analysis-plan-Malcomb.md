# Planned revisions to reproduction of the Malcomb et al's Study (2014)

Author: Katie Heo

## Analysis

I will be working on ... 

1. Changing the color scheme of the map that reflects differences between the reproduction and the original study for Figure 5. The current pastel purple-pastel pink scheme makes it difficult to tell the vulnerability level apart as the paler pink and purple areas blend.

## Results

1. This is a data visualization problem that can be fixed by changing the hex codes. I will use the hex codes of a divergent color scheme (green-brown) to clearly mark the areas that are clearly more or less vulnerable in the reproduction and the original study.

## Discussion

1. If my revised map shows a clearer outline of which areas the reproduction has a higher vulnerability level, the original study has a higher vulnerability level, and which areas the reproduction and original study show equal vulnerability, it means that there is a better visualization of data in the map. This would make it easier to tell the white areas (reproduction - original = 0) apart as well as the hex codes I chose are darker shades than the previous pink and purple that made it difficult to identify certain areas.

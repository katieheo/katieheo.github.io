# Planned revisions to reproduction of the Malcomb et al's Study (2014)

Author: Katie Heo

## Analysis

I will be working on ... 

1. Changing the color scheme of the map that reflects differences between the reproduction and the original study for Figure 5. The current pastel purple-pastel pink scheme makes it difficult to tell the vulnerability level apart as the paler pink and purple areas blend. 





## Results

1. This is a data visualization problem that can be fixed by changing the hex codes. I will use the hex codes of a divergent color scheme (green-brown) to clearly mark the areas that are clearly more or less vulnerable in the reproduction and the original study. 




2. The midpoint in the original study was set to the default of 0. Hence, the original map only reflected the darker shades of orange of the diverging color scale, making it hard for readers to differentiate the five different shades of orange that the map was supposed to represent. As the Race Model Weights vary between 0.027 and 1, I will choose the mean of 0.51 (rounded to the nearest hundredth) to represent the midpoint. By doing this, I was able to better visualize the data for the Race Model Weights.

3. I will move the rationale's position to the bottom. 

4. I will improve the formatting of the missing data table with Kable and KableExtra functions. I will also transpose the table to vertical orientation.

5. I will integrate our conclusion with the original study's conclusion.  

6. I will separate a conclusions section from the discussion.

7. I will map each county's weight in GEE model for ethnicity, poverty status, age, and biological sex like the GEE model mapped for race in the original study. 


## Discussion

1. If my revised map shows a clearer outline of which areas the reproduction has a higher vulnerability level, the original study has a higher vulnerability level, and which areas the reproduction and original study show equal vulnerability, it means that there is a better visualization of data in the map. This would make it easier to tell the white areas (reproduction - original = 0) apart as well as the hex codes I chose are darker shades than the previous pink and purple that made it difficult to identify certain areas.



2. The revised study would improve the flow of the study for an easier read. Moving the rationale's position to the bottom will help wrap back to the importance of the research.

3. If the table is transposed vertically and the missing data table is sorted, it will be easier for the reader to understand what we are trying to convey with the table.

4. Integrating our conclusion with the original study will help understand the importance of replicability. This will help synthesize the findings we found and think about their implications.

5. Having a clear separation between the conclusion and the discussion will help see whether the reproduction attempt was successful, and what the implications are for how the original study contributes to scientific knowledge.

6. After comparing the different chloropleth maps, I will be able to tell whether the Race Model Weights is a representative map of all five maps. If not, I should be able to note differences in the map and infer why they exist.

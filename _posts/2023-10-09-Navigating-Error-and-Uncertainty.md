GIS today creates the impression that geographic representations are inherently precise, and that spatial analysis can flawlessly encapsulate our world. However, I argue that the complex tools we have today do not eliminate the errors and uncertainties that come with spatial analysis. As Longley et al. state, we become more uncertain about the quality of our digital representation with more and better data at our disposal. Uncertainty is an inherent aspect of geographic research, and as a GIS student, I will delve into the complexities of managing and understanding it. In this blog post, I will explore Figure 6.1 from Longley et al.'s "Geographical Information Systems and Science" (2008) and reflect on how geographers can address uncertainty, drawing insights from Tullis and Kar's (2021) perspective on ethical replicability and reproducibility in GIScience.

Longley et al. identify three primary sources of uncertainty in the research process, as illustrated in the figure below. It vividly illustrates the complexity of how uncertainty manifests at different stages, from initial real-world observations to subsequent laboratory analysis.

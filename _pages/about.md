Hi! I'm Katie. I call Seoul, South Korea home but have previously resided in the Philippines and Germany. I am currently based in Middlebury, Vermont, where I am studying Geography and Environmental Justice at Middlebury College. 

My experiences include corporate communications and organizational portfolio development. I spent the last summer working as an Associate for the Institute of Climate and Peace, a 501(c)(3) organization based out of Honolulu, Hawai ªi that advances just and sustainable peace for thriving, cohesive communities. I worked closely with the operational management team to contribute to the development and implementation of the organization's portfolio, focusing on information and education, collaboration, and policy transformation. 

I am passionate about cooking Korean food (*I make the best kimchi-jjigae*), sustainability, and environmental storytelling.
